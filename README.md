# Small-Solar-System-Model

This program uses Java GUI in order to create a small solar system animation of the Earth rotating around the Sun with its moon and Mars in the background.

The program allows you to input the Earth's speed (pix/sec) at which the animation will rotate it around the sun. This input is also used to calculate the Moon and Mar's speed in relation to the Earth to mimic some similarity to the real world.

    To run type "sh run.sh" in terminal in the folder with all the files
